## Selection is a minimalist portfolio concept, straight to the point, consuming resources already available on Github in a smart approach.

This project uses:
- React 
- Javascript 
- Nextjs 
- Tailwindcss


## You can use selection easily:
- Setting the GITHUB_API_TOKEN with your GitHub token
- Setting the lib/config.json file

### What you can change from config.json:
- "USERNAME": username from Github,
- "LINKEDIN_URL": the name says it all, the link to your linkedin,
- "KEY_TAG": only repositories that contain this tag will be displayed, by the way you can change the tag you are looking for here

### Another important point is that the repositories shown must follow the following:
- have the "KEY_TAG"
- have a directory called _docs in the root
- cover.svg file with the image to be displayed within _docs, which will be the cover for the project.

I recommend using Vercel as a hoster
